## Introduction to Web Frameworks and Basics of Flask and Jinja

1. **What is a Web Framework?**: A web framework provides a structure for developing web applications by offering tools, libraries, and predefined patterns to streamline development tasks.

2. **A Minimal Application**: This section likely covers the basics of setting up a minimal web application using Flask, which includes initializing the Flask application and defining routes.

3. **Routing (except “HTTP Methods”)**: Routing involves mapping URLs to functions that handle HTTP requests. Flask provides a routing mechanism to define routes for different URLs.

4. **Rendering Templates**: Templating engines like Jinja allow developers to generate dynamic content by combining static template files with data. This section likely covers how to render templates in Flask using Jinja.

5. **Synopsis**: This might provide an overview of Flask and its key features, including its lightweight nature, flexibility, and extensive documentation.

6. **Variables**: Jinja allows the use of variables within templates, enabling dynamic content generation based on data passed from the application.

7. **Comments**: Jinja supports comments within template files, allowing developers to add comments for clarity or documentation purposes.

8. **Whitespace Control**: Jinja provides control over whitespace in templates, allowing developers to manage indentation and line breaks for cleaner output.

9. **List of Control Structures (read up to “Call”)**: Jinja offers various control structures such as loops, conditionals, and macros to facilitate dynamic content generation within templates.

10. **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developing web applications.

11. **Jinja**: Jinja is a modern and designer-friendly templating engine for Python. It is inspired by Django's templating system but provides its own syntax and features.

In summary, this module provides an introduction to web frameworks, focusing on Flask as a Python web framework, and covers the basics of routing, template rendering, and using Jinja for templating within Flask applications.
